# MEAN-messager
This messager project is for my personal practice. Using MongoDB, Express, Angular2.0 and Node teck stack.
It has been deployed onto Amazon Web Service(AWS) on below link.

Feel free to go to that page and take a look at it.
I use MongoLab as my online database, and using express and node to implement the backend service. Using Angular2.0 to build front end web page.
The messager app has basic CRUD function for manipulating messages. And also I use JSON Web Token(JWT) to do the authentication part for user to sign up and sign in.
